# LFG MatchMaker TBC

[Changelog history](https://github.com/fs86/LFG_MatchMaker_TBC/blob/master/CHANGELOG_HISTORY.md)

## 1.10.0

**Technical info:** This release jumps to version number 1.10.0 to better reflect past changes. Many new features have been added that should have resulted in an increase in the minor version number rather than the patch level.

**Functional changes in this release:**

- Players guild names are now shown in info / popup dialog
- Added arena 2vs2, 3vs3 and 5vs5 for PvP category
- Added new dungeon identifiers for COT1 and Shadow Lab.
- Added russian dungeon identifiers. Currently only for TBC dungeons (not PvP).
- Possibility to add dungeons that will be released in a future phase. These dungeons will then be shown once the phase is live.
- Changed internal dungeon indexes. **If any LUA errors occur, please delete the SavedVariables file 'LFG_MatchMaker_TBC.lua' in your Account directory.**

**What's next?**\
I can't make any promises at this point, but I will try to include role selection for the LFG and LFM tab for one of the next versions.
