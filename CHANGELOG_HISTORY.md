# LFG MatchMaker TBC

## v1.0.4d-tbc

- Minor Bugfixes (primary for testing automated deployments to curseforge)

## v1.0.4c-tbc

- Added more dungeon identifiers

## v1.0.4b-tbc

- Fix for HC filter fix :-)
- Added more HC and boost filter identifiers

## v1.0.4a-tbc

- Bugfix: The HC filter should now work a little more accurately.

## v1.0.4-tbc

- Added mode filter to TBC dungeons (available modes are: none, Heroic, Normal)
  Important: Filtering for specific modes is only available for LFG / LFM tab. In addition, the filter is not yet 100% accurate, which means that one or the other message is not displayed as a match. I will try to improve the filter for future versions. For the search for raids the filter should be deactivated (Mode: none).
